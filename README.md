## Unit 10—A Yen for the Future

### Time-Series Forecasting

Based on the time series analysis, I would buy the Yen as the ARMA and ARIMA models both predict the Yen to appreciate against the USD.  Moreover, based on the Garch model, the volatility/risk is also expected to increase in the near future.  I would be a little hesitant to rely on the ARMA and ARIMA models for trading activity because of the moderate size of the p-values (>0.05), I would invest in a butterfly spread option strategy to profit on the Yen appreciation against the USD and the scale of the estimated volatility.   

### Linear Regression Forecasting

Based on linear regression analysis, the Yen futures out-of-sample RMSE is lower than the in-sample RMSE. RMSE is typically lower for training data, but is higher in this case.  This suggests that the linear regression forecasting methodology needs additional data to refine("learn") to better predict Yen futures.
